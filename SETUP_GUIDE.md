## Initial Setup

### Preparing the Plugin

1. Download the plugin package
2. For each client website, create a copy of the plugin
3. You may want to customize the plugin name/branding for each client
4. Ensure each client has their own OpenAI API key

### Plugin Installation

1. Log in to the client's WordPress admin dashboard
2. Navigate to Plugins > Add New > Upload Plugin
3. Upload the zip file of the plugin
4. Click "Install Now" and then "Activate"

### API Key Configuration

Each client needs their own OpenAI API key:

1. Direct clients to create an account at [OpenAI Platform](https://platform.openai.com/)
2. Have them generate an API key under their account settings
3. Set up billing for their OpenAI account
4. Configure usage limits to prevent unexpected charges

## Client-Specific Configuration

### Basic Configuration

For each client site:

1. Navigate to GPT Chatbot in the admin menu
2. Enter their unique OpenAI API key
3. Select the appropriate model (GPT-3.5-Turbo is recommended for cost efficiency)
4. Add client-specific training material (see [Training Material Guidelines](#training-material-guidelines))
5. Customize appearance to match the client's brand:
   - Set colors to match the client's website
   - Name the bot appropriately (e.g., "Company Name Assistant")
   - Create a welcoming greeting message

### Implementation Options

The plugin offers two different ways to implement the chatbot:

#### 1. Floating Widget (Default)

This is the default implementation that shows a chat button in the corner of the website. When clicked, it opens a chat window.

- Requires no additional setup
- Appears on all pages by default
- Can be controlled with filters (see Advanced Configuration)

#### 2. Inline Shortcode

You can embed the chatbot directly within page content using a shortcode:

```
[wp_gpt_chatbot]
```

The shortcode accepts these optional parameters:

- `height`: The height of the chatbot container (default: '400px')
- `welcome_message`: Custom welcome message for this specific instance

Example with parameters:

```
[wp_gpt_chatbot height="500px" welcome_message="Hello! How can I help you today?"]
```

This is ideal for:
- Dedicated FAQ or support pages
- Knowledge base articles
- Product pages where context-specific help is needed

### Advanced Configuration

To control chatbot behavior on specific pages:

```php
// Add to client's theme functions.php or in a site-specific plugin

// Example: Hide chatbot on certain pages
add_filter('wp_gpt_chatbot_display', function($display) {
    // Customize this list for each client
    $excluded_pages = array('contact', 'privacy-policy', 'terms-of-service');
    
    if (is_page($excluded_pages)) {
        return false;
    }
    return $display;
});

// Example: Control chat history length
add_filter('wp_gpt_chatbot_history_length', function($length) {
    return 15; // Adjust based on client needs (default is 10)
});
```

## Training Material Guidelines

### ChatGPT Model Selection

Guide clients on model selection:

- **GPT-3.5-Turbo**: Less expensive, fast responses, good for most applications
- **GPT-4**: More expensive, better understanding, better for complex topics

## Testing and Quality Assurance

Before client handover, thoroughly test the chatbot:

1. **Functionality Testing**:
   - Verify the chatbot appears correctly on all device types
   - Test opening, closing, and sending messages
   - Check that responses are received within an acceptable time frame

2. **Content Testing**:
   - Create a test script with common questions customers might ask
   - Verify responses are accurate, helpful, and on-brand
   - Test edge cases and potentially problematic questions
   - Ensure the chatbot properly handles questions it can't answer

3. **Performance Testing**:
   - Test on various browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
   - Test on mobile devices
   - Verify the chatbot doesn't impact website loading speed

## Client Handover

Prepare documentation for the client:

1. **Client User Guide**:
   - How to access the chatbot settings
   - How to update the training material
